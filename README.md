# JPetBot

A pet bot made for our server because why not. At this point, we are just doing it to atleast have a successful collab, rather than making a bot for a server's sake.

RIP DISCORD.PY 😞 <br>
AND HELLLLOOOOW JDA 👯‍♂️ <br>
brrrrrrrrrrrr param papparappparaaaa


Will continue soon... exams man :pensive:
Tried a very different approach owo. Im still thinking if there really is any kind of gain here. <br>
The idea was to make just a single listener, and according to the command, execute that particular commmand function. <br>
So the bot only registers one Listener, whilst being able to listen to all commands, so i think we save memory?? :thinking:

Im suprised the project is still not complete. When will i have atleast 1 complete project on my github lmao?!?!
